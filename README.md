# 🎄 [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in Rust 🦀

My solutions to Advent of Code 2022.  Each year I like to try in a
language I'm interested in or may be using soon.

Last year I used
Advent of Code to learn Clojure (https://github.com/andy2mrqz/aoc-2021).

- [Day 1](./src/bin/01.rs)
- [Day 2](./src/bin/02.rs)
- [Day 3](./src/bin/03.rs)
- [Day 4](./src/bin/04.rs)
- [Day 5](./src/bin/05.rs)
- [Day 6](./src/bin/06.rs)

## ⭐ Running the code

Each day is its own binary in `./src/bin` (format 01.rs).  The corresponding
input file should be placed in `./src/inputs` (format 01.txt).

```sh
# The days can be run independently...
cargo run --bin 01

# or all at once
cargo run
```
