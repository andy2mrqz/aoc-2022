# üéÑ [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in Rust ü¶Ä

My solutions to Advent of Code 2022. Each year I like to try in a
language I'm interested in or may be using soon.

## ‚≠ê Running the code

Each day is its own binary in `./src/bin` (format 01.rs). The corresponding
input file should be placed in `./src/inputs` (format 01.txt).

```sh
# The days can be run independently...
cargo run --bin 01

# or all at once
cargo run
```
